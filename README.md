## MDM2: Crap-fi drum machine module for Eurorack

This is the through-hole reincarnation of one of my old modules, the MDM (Modular Drum Machine) - I call it a crap-fi module because, let's face it, the sounds that you'll get out of it are rough, ready and pretty characterful.

The board features:

- Two tunable twin-T kick/bass drum oscillators - get everything from flabby kicks through to woodblocks and howling feedback. They can also be used as notch filters too, for added lulz.
- Two sets of tunable square-wave oscillators; kind of like a cut down version of the 808-style digital noise source; Schmitt trigger abuse for fun and profit.
- Two transistor VCAs - again, inspired by Roland's 808 design. Use the on-board oscillators plus an external envelope to get nice, clashy cymbal sounds.

Note that this isn't an ideal beginner's kit, although if you're patient and can hold a soldering iron at the right end then you can do it.

- `mdm2-schematic.png` - module schematic (this is what you're building ...)
- `mdm.mp3` and `mdm2-snippet.mp3` - a couple of sound samples; these are representative of what the module can sound like; how it ultimately turns out depends on how you build it.
